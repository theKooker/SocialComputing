It provides rich graph data structures and many out-of-the-box functions to process graphs and calculate different metrics. The tasks below should make you familiar with the library.<br>\n",

    "To give you a short background on graph visualization, it is the research area in mathematics/computer science concerned with drawing graphs. It has applications in many fields, one of them is social computing. The quality of graph visualization is measured based on certain criteria, for example crossing minimization and bend minimization. There are many graph drawing algorithms that vary in their quality according to the graph's application and size. One technique is to draw graphs by using physical analogies.<br>\n",
    "The basic idea of this technique is to associate edges between graph nodes with physical forces acting upon the nodes and computing an energy minimum. By setting off the dynamics that is induced by the forces, the graph will finally settle into a natural optimal display. A famous algorithm that implements this technique is the **Fruchtermann-Rheingold** algorithm. Its basic idea is to replace the graph edges with mechanical springs, and let the springs move the system to a minimal energy state.\n"
